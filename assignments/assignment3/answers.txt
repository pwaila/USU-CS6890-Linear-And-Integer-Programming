Problem1(4/4) Good. Your code no longer hangs.

Problem2 (0.5/1)
The problem has solution:
z = 8.0 x1 = 2.0 x2 = 2.0 x3 = 1.0 x4 = 5.0 x5 = 0 x6=0

Problem3(1/1) Correct!

Problem4(1.5/2)
The answer should look like:
x0 = 30.0 x1 = 0 x2 = 200.0 x3 = 210.0 x4 = 0 z = 90

Problem5(1.5/2)
The answer should look like:
x0 = 3.0 x1 = 14.0 x2 = 0 x3 = 400.0 x4 = 1200.0 x5 = 0 z = 62
