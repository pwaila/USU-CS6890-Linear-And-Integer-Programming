Problem 1 (0.9/1)
The final matrix should look as follows: 1 0 1 -3 | -14 0 1 0 -1 | -9
So, the solution is x3 = 4, x4 = s, x1 = -4 + 3s - 14, x2 = s - 9, where s and r are reals,
because the columns 3 and 4 do not have any pivots.

Problem 2 (1/1)
The last row should have 3 instead of 4 in (4, 3).

Problem 3 (1/1) Great!

Problem 4 (0/1)
The answer to both questions is no.

Problem 5 (1/1) Great!

Problem 6 (1/1)
Your answers is not worded properly.
Yes, these vectors are in R^3 but the answer should be these 3 vectors generate R^3.

Problem 7 (1/1) OK.

Problem 8 (1/1) Great!

Problem 9 (0.5/1)
No, this is not correct. The basis for the column space must have 3D vectors.
You should row reduce it and then take the pivot columns from the original matrix.

Problem 10 (1/1) Correct!
